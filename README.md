# 📖Bookbot
BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project!
This is a Python mini project for analysing text files.

## What this project will do?

The CLI [Command Line Interface] will take a book and analyze the texts and show total words and count all the unique characters and show it in output.

## Output
